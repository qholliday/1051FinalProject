# 1051FinalProject
 
 Quinn and I have worked together to create a final project we are both proud of. We both took this oppurtiunity as beginners in programming
 to take on what we would like to call a passion project. This ended up being a video game. The game is a traditional 2D platformer titled "Witches Revenge".
 In this game you play as a witch that can shoot magic and vortex bombs(further details in demo video). We were willing to step outside our comfort zone and learn. 
 During proposal we had dreamnt up this full fledged game with dialouge, custom art, and much more. As beginners in python we did not realize the 
 difficulty of a task this actually was. We did our due diligence and watched hours of film just to begin to understand pygame's functions and logic. 
 We then followed a tutorial to create a platformer and customized it to be our own. We wanted to customize even more but our lack of coding knowledge
 held us back at many steps. We did our best with the amount of time given and while at it, learned so much about pygame and can hopefully go back
 another time and create something together with much more time on our hands. Who know's we may create the greatest game to ever come out. In the 
 end, we did not see through our orginal vision but we still came out on top with a game. We did end with an outcome we are both happy to submit.
 
 DEMONSTRATION VIDEO [https://youtu.be/iyRVj1cBEI8] P.S. YouTube destroys the video quailty for some reason, if hard to view or see animation. I'd be more then happy to email orginal video file to whoever grades this.
