# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

God of war 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game with a side scrolling platform. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We plan on creating a game that has a character, or bot, move on top of fixed objects in a side scrolling platform. Our software will have the user control the character in order to play the game level. It will have animated features. And it will be executed by the user playing the game with the keys on their keyboard. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Gino Russo, Gino.russo@temple.edu, Bin Li
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good version of outcome of this project will be for us to create a game with block imaging to have a simple character move accross the blocks. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome of this project is for the game to be animated better with more details and the character to still move accross the objects along the plane. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is if the user is able to fully use the animated character along a fully animated plane, and accomplish one or more levels. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We are going to decide what software we want to use to accomplish this project
create a timeline and set some goals
research if needed 
start working on the goals
set times to sit down and collaborate
We will pretty much work together on this project. We do a lot of virutal collaboration so most work will be done at the same time. But if work is done seperatly it will be sections at a time.
